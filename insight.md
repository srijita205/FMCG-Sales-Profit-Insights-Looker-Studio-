Retail Profitability Analysis – Global FMCG Dashboard
Project Overview

This project analyzes global retail profitability across products, promotions, and geographies using interactive dashboards. The objective was to identify profit drivers, cost efficiency, and risk concentration to support strategic business decisions.

The analysis focuses on sales performance, profit margins, promotion effectiveness, and regional contribution across 1.6K products in the global FMCG and consumer electronics space.

Business Problem

Retail organizations often track revenue but fail to understand:

Which products truly drive profit

Whether discounts actually improve profitability

How geographically concentrated their earnings are

This project addresses these gaps by shifting the analysis from sales-centric to profit-centric decision making.

Key Metrics Analyzed

Total Sales

Total Profit

Sales Cost and Unit Cost

Product Count

Profit by Product Category & Sub-Category

Profit by Promotion Type

Profit by Country and Region

Tools & Technologies

Google Looker Studio – Interactive dashboard development

Data Modeling & Aggregation – KPI calculation and metric structuring

Business Analysis – Profitability, cost efficiency, and risk assessment

Key Insights
1. Overall Performance

Generated 55.4M in sales with 31.6M in profit, indicating a strong profit margin.

Sales costs were significantly lower than revenue, highlighting effective cost control.

2. Product Profitability

Computers and Cameras & Camcorders contributed over 70% of total profit, making them the core profit engines.

Several categories generated revenue but added limited profit, indicating portfolio inefficiency.

3. Promotion Effectiveness

No-discount sales produced the highest profit, outperforming all promotional campaigns.

Seasonal promotions increased volume but delivered lower margin efficiency.

4. Geographic Concentration

The United States alone contributed more than half of global profit, creating high geographic dependency.

Emerging markets showed low profit contribution despite market presence.

5. Risk Identification

High reliance on a small number of product categories and a single dominant market.

Potential margin erosion risk if discount-heavy strategies are expanded.

Business Recommendations

Protect and scale high-margin categories through pricing discipline and supply chain stability.

Rationalize or reposition low-profit product segments.

Expand internationally with a profit-first strategy, not volume-driven growth.

Shift promotion strategy toward targeted, brand-led campaigns instead of blanket discounts.
